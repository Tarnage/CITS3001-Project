need to decide:
	opinion gain
		Before or after losing followers?
		Flat amount or changes depending on their current value?	
		what happens if opinion of both sides are the same?
	
	opinion lost:
		when will this happen?

	how much followers/energy lost
		what type of followers lost? only people who dont agree? or lower chance of people who dont agree 
			(currently its just anyone randomly)

	Blue agent: 
		do they affect everyones opinions? or just people who agree with them more? 

	
	NetworkX alternative to get real time view of connections?
