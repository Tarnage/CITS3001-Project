need to decide:
	opinion gain
		Before or after losing followers?
		Flat amount or changes depending on their current value?	
		what happens if opinion of both sides are the same?
	
	opinion lost:
		when will this happen?

	how much followers/energy lost
		what type of followers lost? only people who dont agree? or lower chance of people who dont agree 
			(currently its just anyone randomly)

	Blue agent: 
		do they affect everyones opinions? or just people who agree with them more? 

	
	NetworkX alternative to get real time view of connections?
	Tom:
		We can use networkx to get real time data. Networkx uses matplotlib to show the graph.

		Leave this with me and I'll implement it.
		
		Recall Cits3003 Graphics and animation
		
		Basically we need to:
		- Ensure matplotlib doesnt block the program
		- clear the display
		- update the information in the graph
		- reload the display

		Adding:
		- plot.clf()
		- will clear the screen
		
		- nx.draw()
		- will update the display

		- plt.show(block=False)
		- will make sure matplotlib doesnt block
